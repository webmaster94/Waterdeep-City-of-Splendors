The interior is lushly decorated with carpets and tapestries on nearly every surface. In addition to being magically lit, the interior of the building is also magically heated and cooled, providing a welcome comfort no matter the season. Weapons are not permitted inside the Gentle Mermaid, so guests will be expected to check any they are carrying with the coatroom attendant, though guests are not searched for or even asked to remove any but openly worn weapons. The Mermaid is confident in their security. Any person not wearing ï¬ne clothes is turned away per the establishmentâ€™s dress code.
